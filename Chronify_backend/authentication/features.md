Here’s a comprehensive **feature list for the authentication system** for your event management project. Each feature corresponds to specific needs, such as handling user roles (Admin, Organizer, and Participant), permissions, and integration with other components like email-based actions and JWT authentication.

---

### **1. Custom User Model**
- **Roles:** `Admin`, `Organizer`, `Participant` (with predefined permissions for each role).
- **Email as the Primary Identifier:** Users are identified by their email, not username.
- **Role Field:** This field determines the user’s role and permissions.
  - `Admin`: Full access to manage users, events, and settings.
  - `Organizer`: Can manage events (create, edit, delete).
  - `Participant`: Can view events and register for them.

### **2. JWT Authentication**
- **JWT Token Generation**: On successful login, the server returns an access token and refresh token for user authentication.
  - `Access Token`: Short-lived token for making API requests.
  - `Refresh Token`: Used to obtain a new access token when it expires.
- **Secure Token Handling**: Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies or local storage on the frontend.

### **3. Registration System**
- **Role Selection on Registration**: During registration, users select or are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, Organizer, Participant).
- **Email Validation**: Users must verify their email before their account becomes active.
- **Automatic Group Assignment**: Based on the user’s role, they are assigned to corresponding Django groups (Admin, Organizer, Participant).

### **4. Login System**
- **Login via Email and Password**: Users log in with their email and password.
- **Role-based Authentication**: The system checks the user’s role and returns appropriate permissions upon successful login.

### **5. Password Reset**
- **Password Reset Request**: Users can request a password reset by providing their email.
- **Email Link for Reset**: An email with a link to reset the password is sent.
- **Link Expiration**: The password reset link expires after a set period for security.
- **Email Templates**: Use HTML-based email templates for password reset emails.

### **6. Account Activation**
- **Email Activation**: New users are required to activate their accounts via an email link.
- **Custom Activation Link**: The link contains a token that verifies the user’s identity before enabling full access.

### **7. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- **OTP Generation**: Send a one-time password (OTP) to the user’s email when they attempt to log in or perform sensitive actions.
- **OTP Validation**: The user must provide the correct OTP to complete the action.

### **8. Account Locking on Failed Login**
- **Failed Login Tracking**: Track failed login attempts and lock accounts after multiple failed attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).
- **Account Lock Duration**: Temporarily lock accounts for a specific time after reaching the max failed login attempts.
- **Logging of Failed Attempts**: Log each failed attempt for security monitoring.

### **9. Role-based Permissions**
- **Admin Permissions**: Admin users have full access to create, update, delete, and manage users and events.
- **Organizer Permissions**: Organizers can manage events (create, view, update, delete) but have limited user management access.
- **Participant Permissions**: Participants can view events and register, but cannot manage events or users.
- **Django Group Integration**: Use Django’s `Group` model to associate specific permissions with each role.

### **10. Asynchronous Tasks (Celery)**
- **Email Sending**: Use Celery to send emails asynchronously (e.g., password reset, account activation, and OTP emails) to avoid blocking the main request cycle.
- **Cleanup Tasks**: Use periodic tasks for cleanup operations like removing expired tokens, logging out inactive users, and cleaning up expired OTP codes.

### **11. Permissions Management (Django's Built-in Permissions)**
- **Custom Permissions**: Define custom permissions in `permissions.py` for different roles (Admin, Organizer, Participant).
- **Role-based Access Control**: Protect views using `IsAdmin`, `IsOrganizer`, or `IsParticipant` permissions.

### **12. Frontend Integration (Next.js)**
- **Registration and Login Forms**: Provide forms for users to register, log in, and select their roles.
- **Token Storage**: Store the JWT tokens securely (in an HTTP-only cookie or localStorage).
- **Protected Routes**: Use the tokens to protect certain pages or API routes that require authentication (e.g., admin dashboards, event creation).
- **Role-based Views**: Display different views or components based on the user’s role. For example, only admins can access user management pages.
  
### **13. Frontend Role-based Access**
- **Admin Panel**: The admin can access the admin panel to manage users, roles, and events.
- **Organizer Dashboard**: Organizers can view and manage their events, track registrations, and interact with participants.
- **Participant Dashboard**: Participants can view events, register, and update their profiles.

### **14. Permissions and Role Enforcement**
- **Custom Permissions for Views**: Implement role-based access control on Django views using `IsAdmin`, `IsOrganizer`, and `IsParticipant` permissions to ensure that users only access content they're authorized to view or modify.
- **Decorators**: Use Django REST Framework’s `@permission_classes` decorators on views to enforce these permissions.
  
### **15. Admin Interface**
- **Customizing the Django Admin**: Customize the Django admin to show user roles, manage user permissions, and perform user and event management.

### **Features Overview**

| **Feature**                         | **Description**                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Custom User Model**               | Users have roles: Admin, Organizer, and Participant. Roles define what the user can access.      |
| **JWT Authentication**              | Tokens (access and refresh) are used for user authentication and authorization.                  |
| **Email-based Account Activation** | User account must be activated via email verification link before access is granted.             |
| **Password Reset**                  | Users can reset their passwords via email.                                                        |
| **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** | Send OTP via email for sensitive actions (like login or changing password).                       |
| **Role-based Permissions**          | Different roles (Admin, Organizer, Participant) have specific permissions, controlling access.     |
| **Account Locking**                 | Accounts are locked after several failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.           |
| **Admin and Organizer Views**       | Admins and Organizers can manage users, events, and registrations.                               |
| **Asynchronous Email Tasks**        | Email tasks (password reset, OTP, account activation) are handled asynchronously with Celery.    |
| **Protected Routes**                | Use JWT tokens for protecting backend API routes in Next.js based on user roles.                  |

### **Next Steps**
1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test each functionality—registering users with different roles, logging in, role-based access to resources, password reset, and email activation.
2. **Frontend Integration**: Integrate this backend system with your **Next.js frontend**, handling user registration, login, and token storage.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy your system to production, ensuring that JWT tokens and emails are correctly handled.

These features should give your **event management application** robust user authentication and role-based access control, ensuring each user type (Admin, Organizer, Participant) has the proper permissions to interact with your system.
